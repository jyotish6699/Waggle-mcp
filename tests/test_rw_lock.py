"""Tests for _ReadWriteLock – resolves issue #67.

File: tests/test_rw_lock.py

Run with:
    pytest tests/test_rw_lock.py -v

These tests verify:
1. Basic write-lock exclusivity across threads
2. Concurrent readers are allowed
3. Writer → reader re-entrance is allowed (writer shortcut)
4. Writer → writer re-entrance is allowed (recursive write)
5. Reader → reader re-entrance is allowed (per-thread depth)
6. [ISSUE #67] Reader → writer on same thread raises RuntimeError immediately
7. No thread hangs after a refused upgrade (core acceptance criterion)
8. Lock state is clean after a refused upgrade
